uC, originally an atmel AT89C2051 (intel 8051 compatible)
pin names here are per atmel attiny2313 convention (pin-compatible), because 
that's what I plan on swapping in.

Crystal Y1 is 11.0592 mhz.


Q1 DS1833 reset chip
	This 3-lead (TO-92) device controls the reset line.  On power-up, it holds 
	reset high.  It waits for ~1/2 second after power on, then sets the reset 
	line low.  This works fine for the AT89C2051, which has an active-high 
	reset.  However, it prevents an attiny2313 from working in this board, as 
	the attiny has an active-low reset.  To fix this, clip the center lead on 
	Q1, or just remove the device altogether.


U2 74HCT573 octal latch
	This latch is for the switches.
	LatchEnable is tied high, which means that its always reading from its 
	Dx lines.
	Input pins are connected to the switches.
	Output pins are connected to the bus.

U3 74HCT573 octal latch
	This latch is for the LEDs.
	OutputEnable is tied low, which means its outputs are always enabled.
	Input pins are connected to the bus.
	Output pins go to the LEDs.

U4 74HCT573 octal latch
	This latch is for the switches.
	LatchEnable is tied high, which means that its always reading from its 
	Dx lines.
	Input pins are connected to the switches.
	Output pins are connected to the bus.

U5 74HCT573 octal latch
	This latch is for the LEDs.
	OutputEnable is tied low, which means its outputs are always enabled.
	Input pins are connected to the bus.
	Output pins go to the LEDs.

U6 SIPEX SP3232 RS-232 tranceiver
	T1, T2, and R1 are used.  R2 does not appear to be used.
	
J1 10-pin header
	the ribbon cable is wired weird.  here's the J1 header with the DB9 pin numbers.

1 6
2 7
3 8

             Vin  1 6  U6 pin8 "R2IN"
U6 pin13 "R1IN"   2 7
U6 pin14 "T1OUT"  3 8
U6 pin7 "T2OUT"   4 9  R15 (1K), which is connected to U2's input D7 (weird)
             Gnd  5 x
