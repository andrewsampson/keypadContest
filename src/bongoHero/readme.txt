Bongo Hero is a one person game modeled after the popular guitar game. The game has three user selectable levels of increasing difficulty that are selectable when power is applied. Unlike all the other entries submitted for our contest, Bongo Hero is played with the keypad controller rotated 90 degrees from normal. For gameplay, lights "fall" from button 1 to button 5 for the right "bongo", and from button 6 to 10 for the left "bongo". When the lights reach the bottom row, players must hit the appropriate "bongo" (either button 5 or 10) in time with the lights. When the bongos are hit in tempo, all lights in that row illuminate for 0.1sec to indicate a proper hit. The sequence and tempo for each level are programmed into the software. Level 1 is a basic, slow rhythm. Level 2 is 'Back in Black'. Level 3 is 'Rock and Roll'. After each level completes, the software automatically returns to the level selection menu.

The software is written using timers to control the light progression. This makes controlling tempo extremely easy, and accurate. The sequence of hits is programmed as two separate byte-arrays for each bongo. The sequence is played using nested for-loops, and bit-shift arithmetic. The inner-most for loop continuously reads from the switches until the timer indicates the next note should be played.

The author considered adding two Photo-Trasistors and Infrared LEDs to the side of the device in order to sense hand movement using an actual set of bongos, but ultimately, it was decided that he wasn't getting paid enough for that.
